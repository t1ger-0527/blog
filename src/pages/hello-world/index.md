After two years of working as an software engineer, I finally decided to start my blog.

## A Dramatic Life Change
The very first reason I made this decision is that I got a new job at [Shopee](https://shopee.sg/), a south-east Asia 
e-commerce company. Which means I will head to another country for work, maybe start new life with my newly wedded wife 
in a country that not totally suck (I'm from China by the way). Dramatic life change makes you want to record what you 
do and what you think during. It's a precious experience, it would be a waste to not write anything about it. 
Maybe this can help someone as well.

## Share My Thoughts
Another reason I want to start a blog, is that I want to share my software engineer experience with the world. I have
been participating in recruiting for almost a year now, and most of times I'm really not satisfied with what I see. 
I would want to shake my candidate up and tell them the 'good' way to treat work and think software things. I can't 
imagine why there are so many (I mean 8 out of 10) so called engineers in China can't even write and understand 
a quick-sort, and still bragging about their work or their leading experience. 

It's not that quick-sort is very important for work or something, you can still write a decent web page if you don't know 
much about quick-sort. I'm trying to express a feeling of disappointment as an first-round interviewer who found out 
their candidate got to be leader while lacking basic knowledge of software engineering all the time. I don't know, 
maybe from someone else's perspective, I'm the one lacking basic knowledge.

Still, with my two years of experience (one leading a small team), there is something about software developing I think 
I could share with the world.

## Practice Technical Writing
English is not my native language, but I will start my new work in Singapore. To better express my idea in workplace, I 
have to have my speaking and writing skill horned. Sometimes expressing your idea is the first step of creating influence, 
right?

## Thanks
From 2016 to yesterday, I worked in [Zhihu.com](https://www.zhihu.com/). And I fortunately have worked with some great 
engineers. [Ambar](https://github.com/ambar) is the coolest person I know, kind but severe. He won't tolerant any 
inefficiency when it comes to develop workflow, but super kind to others when others seek him for help.
